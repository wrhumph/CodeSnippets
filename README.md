CodeSnippets
============

This project contains a variety of Visual Studio code snippets that I use when I am developing with Visual Studio.

To install, use Visual Studio's Code Snippet Manager to add this directory to your code snipped library.  I believe you will
need to do this for each snippet language (currently just CSharp and JavaScript).

Contents
    CSharp - C# snippets for comments and MVC functions
    JavaScript - snippets for comments and AngularJS
    PowerShell - this currently contains only my profile file
